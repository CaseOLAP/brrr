This project is a work in progress intended to support comparison of diagnostic values extracted from clinical reports with reference values and corresponding disease phenotypes.

Files are as follows:

* key.tsv - Descriptions of values in each other file.
* sources.tsv - Sources of names and values curated for these tables.
* measurements.tsv - The bulk of the data, including reference ranges.
* abbreviations.tsv - Common names and abbreviations for each diagnostic test/measurement.
* xrefs.tsv - Cross-references to ontologies and knowledgebases, including LOINC.
